**[Blendid](https://github.com/vigetlabs/blendid)** is a delicious stand-alone blend of tasks and build tools poured together as a full-featured modern asset pipeline. It can be used as-is as a static site builder, or can be configured and integrated into your own development environment and site or app structure.

**Blendid+** adds some features to the default init config of Blendid.

## Quick start on a fresh project (empty directory)

```bash
yarn init
yarn add blendid
yarn run blendid init
yarn run blendid
```

This will create default src and config files in your directory and start compiling and live-updating files! Try editing them and watch your browser auto-update!
